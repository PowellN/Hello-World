# Hello-World
Set up from following the Guide.
I have been a Wintel Consultant for a number (greater than I care to remember) of years. I started my IT career back in the late 1970s working on PDP 1134 Mini computers operating under RSX11-M writing Fortran and Coral 66 programs. In the 80s I progressed through the Z80, BBC, Torch and Unix based PCs. In the early 90s I became a MSDOS fan, progressing through Windows 3.1, Windows 3.11 to Windows 95.From there I progressed through the various Server versions of Windows NT.
